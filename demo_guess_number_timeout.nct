Author: Daniel McKnight
Timeout: 15
Description:
    Neon will select a number between 1 and 10 at random
    and give hints until the user guesses correctly. If there is no response for 15 seconds, the script will exit

Set: neon_num = random(numbers)
Neon speak:
    "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10"
    "Guess what it is or say 'exit'"

    if {user_guess} == {neon_num}:
        Neon speak: "You guessed it!"
